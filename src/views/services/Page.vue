          Robonomics contains a complete set of tools for developing IoT
          applications, both on the robotics and the user interface sides.
          Communication between the user and device happens using the most
          successful technologies from the Web3 world â€“ IPFS, Ethereum, and
          Polkadot. Thus, developers can create modern and secure applications
          for Smart Cities and Industry 4.0.

            The Sensors Robonomics Network is a civilian network of sensors to
            monitor air quality. Anyone can build their own sensor or use an
            off-the-shelf solution from the development team and set it up in
            their home.
